# Block Render
Render Minecraft assets into 3D images. Thanks to the 
[minecraft overviewer](http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/design/designdoc/)
for an easy how-to on the theory here.

I've kept coming back to this project every couple of months for the last 4
years... `blockrender.py` renders png sprites to svg sprites/blocks. `isb.py`
was written for the AP CSP create task in 2019.
